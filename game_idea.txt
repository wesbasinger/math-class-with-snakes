What about a game where you progress in your math skills?

You could set up a class for all the basic operation, and let students
pick which operation to practice on.  As they progress in the game, you could
store their progress to a file.  All of the classes could be in separate files,
to keep code short and readable.  And, since the operations are expandable,
you can easily make the game modular and add new levels.

/////Brainstorming on Possible Classes///////

class Player(object):

  #  __init__ a new player with a name and a zero score

  # has a method for adding to a player's score, writing their info to a file, 
    and retrieving the same info

class Problem(object):

  # __init__ a new problem

class LevelOne(Problem):

  # __init__ anew LevelOne (problem) that is-a Problem
  # adds to the score at a certain amount

class LevelTwo(Problem):

  #same as LevelOne(but with harder numbers, and adds more to the score

class LevelThree(Problem):

  #same as LevelTwo(but with EVEN harder numbers, and adds even MORE to the score)
